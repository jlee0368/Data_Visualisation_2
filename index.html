      <p><br></p>
      <p>MyRTKnet is Malaysia's nationwide <strong>Real-Time Kinematic GNSS reference station network</strong>, maintained by the <strong>Department of Survey and Mapping Malaysia (JUPEM)</strong>. Its goal is to provide real-time GNSS corrections so that users (surveyors, GIS systems, field users) can get centimeter-level accuracy continuously across the country.</p>

    <!-- OVERVIEW MAP -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Network Overview ‚Äî Stations &amp; Major Cities</h2>
      <p><br></p>
      <div class="panel">
        <div id="vis-map" class="figure" role="img" aria-label="Map of MyRTKnet stations and cities"></div>
      </div>
      <p><br></p>
      <p class="lede">The MyRTKnet reference stations are strategically distributed across both <strong>Peninsular Malaysia</strong> and <strong>East Malaysia</strong> (Sabah and Sarawak). Every major region is covered, confirming that JUPEM's network design ensures consistent <strong>nationwide GNSS correction services</strong>. Coverage density is higher along the west coast corridor of Peninsular Malaysia, aligning with population and economic centers like <strong>Klang Valley</strong>, <strong>Penang</strong> and <strong>Johor Bahru</strong>.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p class="lede">City markers vary in opacity by population, with darker grey circles represent denser urban populations. You'll notice that <strong>urban clusters</strong> (Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Johor Bahru, Kuching, Kota Kinabalu) coincide with the <strong>highest density of MyRTKnet stations</strong>, reinforcing optimized access for engineering and infrastructure applications in economically active areas. In contrast, <strong>inner regions</strong> of Sabah and Sarawak show <strong>fewer stations per square kilometer</strong>, highlighting areas where signal redundancy or backhaul infrastructure may be more challenging.</p>

    <!-- REMOTENESS LOLLIPOP -->

      <h2>How Remote Are Stations? ‚Äî Distance to Nearest City</h2>
      <p><br></p>
      <div class="panel">
        <div id="vis-lollipop" class="figure" role="img" aria-label="Lollipop chart of station-to-city distance"></div>
        <div class="caption">Note: This lollipop chart covers only the 25th percentile (Q1), Median (marked as blue circle) and 75th percentile(Q3).</div>
      </div>
      <p><br></p>
      <p class="lede">The chart reveals clear geographic disparities in station remoteness across Malaysia. <strong>Sabah and Sarawak</strong> stand out with median distances <strong>exceeding 150 km</strong>, and wide Q1-Q3 ranges, meaning many stations there are <strong>far from urban centers</strong>. In contrast, states in <strong>Peninsular Malaysia</strong>, especially Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Perak, Pulau Pinang, and Melaka, have much <strong>smaller distances</strong> (typically below 50 km), showing that their reference stations are well integrated into city networks.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p class="lede">For <strong>Sabah and Sarawak</strong>, technicians must <strong>plan for longer travel times</strong> and possibly <strong>off-grid logistics</strong> (fuel, power, and connectivity backups). The <strong>high spread</strong> in these states suggests <strong>access difficulty varies sharply</strong> between coastal and interior sites. For <strong>Pahang and Terengganu</strong>, moderate distances (median ~100 km) indicate a mix of <strong>accessible lowlands</strong> and <strong>mountainous</strong> interior stations that need specialized transport or weather-dependent scheduling. For <strong>urban corridor states</strong>, compact Q1-Q3 ranges indicate consistent, reliable <strong>accessibility</strong> and routine maintenance can be coordinated efficiently.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p><br></p>
      <p class="lede">The histogram of MyRTKnet station heights shows a <strong>strong skew</strong> toward <strong>low-lying elevations</strong>.
      <strong>Over 80%</strong> of stations are sited <strong>below 200 m above mean sea level</strong>, reflecting the concentration of Malaysia's urban and coastal population centers.
      Only a handful of stations <strong>exceed 600 m</strong>, representing those positioned on <strong>upland or interior terrain</strong> (notably in Pahang and Sabah).
      This elevation distribution confirms that the network primarily supports lowland users, where most geospatial, cadastral, and engineering activities occur.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p class="lede">The box plot highlights how station elevation varies geographically.
      <strong>Sabah and Pahang</strong> exhibit the <strong>widest elevation ranges</strong>, with stations extending <strong>above 1,000 m</strong>, indicative of deployment across rugged, mountainous terrain. Most <strong>west-coast states</strong> (Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka, Johor) cluster tightly <strong>below 100 m</strong>, emphasizing accessibility and ease of maintenance. <strong>Sarawak</strong> stations remain relatively low but geographically dispersed, mirroring the state's <strong>broad</strong> but gently undulating terrain. Together, these visuals reveal how terrain directly shapes siting strategy: states with mountainous interiors require elevated installations for <strong>signal visibility</strong> and <strong>network continuity</strong>, while flat coastal states achieve full coverage from lower elevations.</p>

      <p class="lede">The network is dominated by two receiver families: TRIMBLE NETR5 and LEICA GR25.These two appear in small numbers, which are likely newer point upgrades or site-specific replacements.Operationally, this means we only need to track two primary firmware and spare-parts (Trimble vs Leica).</p>

      <h2>Antenna families</h2>
      <p><br></p>
      <p class="lede">Most entries are listed with ‚ÄúNONE‚Äù radome, due to higher exposure to ice, salt spray, and birds. In coastal or high-rain sites, radomes or anti-perch hardware are added to reduce maintenance and multipath. For other, it predominantly consists of TRM55971.00 (Trimble Zephyr Geodetic series) and LEIAR10 (Leica AR10).</p>
